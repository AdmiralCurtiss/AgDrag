Agnostic Dragon - Aspect Ratio Independence for Dragon's Dogma

Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen is hard-coded to 16:9 on all platforms. It is letter boxed at resolutions narrower than 16:9 and generally works aside from that minor annoyance. At resolutions wider than 16:9 almost nothing works correctly and this project is an extensive effort to fix Capcom’s issues on the PC release.

Most of the large game breaking issues have been addressed, but it will take a prolonged effort to get the map and minimap working correctly.
